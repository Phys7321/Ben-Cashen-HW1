I do like how you allowed the domain and the spacing to be specified at runtime for your matlab program. It allowed me to play around. BUT be careful when you do allow this freedom- you run into a problem immediately if you input float variables. The function zeros() only works with integer values, so the program fails if the input isn't just right. 
Also I need you to submit some type of syntax that runs your program in python. It may look like myder has valid functions, but you need to also write some lines to execute the code. But even if you did that you would have found that your thirdorder function doesn't return anything. You forgot a very crucial line.
